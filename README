After compiling the OpenCV library, move cv.so to the 
python 3rd library path. Or you can move cv.so to your 
working directory.


HOW TO RUN?
=====================================

1. Video capturing from the camera:
 $ python GestureLock.py -g sample_grammar.gmr

2. Retrieving frames from a video file:
 $ python GestureLock.py -g sample_grammar.gmr -i video.mp4

3. Select the output image folder:
 $ python GestureLock.py -g sample_grammar.gmr -o output_folder
